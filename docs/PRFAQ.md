**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### New Collaborative Retro Board Platform Transforms Team Retrospectives and Brainstorming Sessions

**[City, Date]** - Today we announce the launch of a next-generation collaborative retro board platform that reimagines how teams conduct retrospectives, brainstorming sessions, and collaborative meetings. This innovative platform enables teams to collect, organize, and prioritize feedback in real-time, whether working remotely or in-person.

**The Problem**

Teams struggle with effective retrospectives and brainstorming sessions. Traditional approaches suffer from several challenges:
- Dominant voices overshadow quieter team members
- Difficulty in organizing and prioritizing large volumes of feedback
- Lack of psychological safety when sharing critical feedback
- Time wasted on manual organization of ideas and themes
- Limited ability to track and visualize team sentiment
- Inflexible formats that don't adapt to different meeting types

**The Solution**

Our retro board platform provides a flexible, intuitive workspace where team members can:
- Share feedback anonymously or with attribution, encouraging honest input
- Express agreement through multiple reaction types, not just simple likes
- Collaboratively organize ideas by grouping related cards
- Visualize priorities through multiple sorting options
- Customize board structures for different meeting types (retrospectives, SWOT analysis, brainstorming)
- Track actionable outcomes directly linked to feedback items

**Key Features**

- **Flexible Card System**: Users create cards with optional name attribution, enabling both accountability and psychological safety
- **Rich Engagement**: Multiple reaction symbols allow nuanced feedback beyond simple agreement
- **Intelligent Organization**: Sort by popularity or recency; manually reorder; group cards by theme
- **Customizable Boards**: Board creators define column structure or use proven templates like "What Went Well", "What Didn't Go Well", "Continue", "Learn"
- **Action Tracking**: Special action item cards link directly to feedback, ensuring follow-through
- **Easy Sharing**: Each board gets a unique shareable link for seamless collaboration
- **Visual Clarity**: Pastel color coding by column for quick visual scanning
- **Future Ready**: Built to expand from retro columns to quadrant-based formats like SWOT

**Customer Quote**

"We needed a tool that let every voice be heard without fear of judgment, while still helping us cut through the noise to find what really matters. This platform finally gives us that balance."

**Availability**

The collaborative retro board platform is available today. Teams can create their first board in minutes and start transforming their retrospectives immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is this platform?**
A: It's a collaborative digital workspace designed for team retrospectives, brainstorming sessions, and structured feedback collection. Teams can create boards with customizable columns, add feedback cards, react to ideas, organize content, and track action items.

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: Any team that conducts retrospectives or collaborative brainstorming sessions - software development teams, product teams, project teams, educators, facilitators, and consultants.

**Q: What makes this different from existing tools?**
A: Our platform uniquely combines anonymous/attributed contributions, flexible reaction systems beyond simple likes, intelligent card grouping, customizable board structures, and integrated action item tracking - all in an intuitive interface designed specifically for retrospectives.

### Board Creation & Setup

**Q: How do I create a new retro board?**
A: Any user can create a new board by giving it a name and choosing which columns to include. The system provides default column templates, or creators can define custom columns.

**Q: What are the default columns?**
A: The default template includes: "What Went Well", "What Did Not Go Well", "What Should We Continue", and "What Actions Should We Learn".

**Q: Can I customize the columns?**
A: Yes. Board creators can define any column structure that fits their needs, whether for retrospectives, brainstorming, SWOT analysis, or other formats.

**Q: How do I share a board with my team?**
A: Each board generates a unique shareable link that the creator can distribute to participants. Anyone with the link can access and contribute to the board.

**Q: Can the board format expand beyond retrospectives?**
A: Yes. While we're launching with column-based layouts optimized for retrospectives, the platform is designed to support quadrant-based formats like SWOT analysis in the future.

### Cards & Contributions

**Q: How do cards work?**
A: Users place cards on the board within specific columns. Each card can display the contributor's name or be anonymous - the choice is up to the individual user for each card they create.

**Q: Why allow anonymous cards?**
A: Anonymity creates psychological safety, encouraging team members to share critical feedback they might otherwise withhold. This leads to more honest, productive conversations.

**Q: Can I control whether my name appears on my cards?**
A: Yes. For each card you create, you choose whether to attach your username or post anonymously.

**Q: Who can delete a card?**
A: Only the original creator of a card can delete it. This prevents accidental or malicious removal of others' contributions.

**Q: How are cards visually distinguished?**
A: Cards in different columns display in different pastel colors, making it easy to visually scan and understand the board structure.

### Engagement & Reactions

**Q: How can I show agreement with a card?**
A: You can give reactions to cards. While thumbs up is common, users can utilize different symbols to express various types of agreement or sentiment.

**Q: Can I see who reacted to a card?**
A: Yes. The platform shows which users have given reactions to each card, providing transparency about team sentiment.

**Q: Are reactions limited to thumbs up?**
A: No. Users can create different symbols for reactions, allowing for more nuanced feedback. However, each user can only use one symbol per card.

**Q: How is card popularity calculated?**
A: Popularity is the sum of all reaction symbols marked on a card. This aggregates all forms of positive engagement.

### Organization & Sorting

**Q: How can I organize cards on the board?**
A: You have multiple options: sort by popularity (reaction count), sort by recency (newest first), manually move cards up and down within a column, or group related cards together by theme.

**Q: What does grouping cards mean?**
A: Users can group multiple cards that share similar themes or topics, making it easier to identify patterns and related issues without losing individual contributions.

**Q: Can anyone move cards around?**
A: Yes. Any board participant can reorder cards or group them, enabling collaborative organization during the session.

**Q: Why both automatic sorting and manual movement?**
A: Different phases of a retrospective benefit from different views. Auto-sorting helps identify top priorities quickly, while manual arrangement allows for deliberate discussion flow and thematic organization.

### Action Items

**Q: How do action items work?**
A: Action items are special cards that can be attached to any existing feedback card. They link to an action items column, creating clear traceability from feedback to follow-up tasks.

**Q: Why are action items separate from regular cards?**
A: Separating action items ensures they're visible and trackable, preventing good intentions from getting lost. The linkage to original cards maintains context for why each action matters.

**Q: Can anyone create action items?**
A: Yes. Any board participant can create action items and link them to relevant feedback cards.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is the data stored?**
A: Cards, columns, boards, and all associated data are persisted in a datastore, ensuring your retrospective content is saved and accessible across sessions.

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: (To be determined based on implementation - web-based, desktop app, or mobile app)

**Q: Can multiple people work on the board simultaneously?**
A: (To be determined - real-time collaboration capabilities)

**Q: Is there a limit to how many cards or boards I can create?**
A: (To be determined based on business model and technical constraints)

### Future Development

**Q: What features are planned for the future?**
A: We're exploring quadrant-based layouts for SWOT analysis, enhanced analytics on retrospective patterns, integration with project management tools, and advanced facilitation features.

**Q: Will you support formats beyond retrospectives?**
A: Yes. While retrospectives are our initial focus, the platform is designed to support various structured brainstorming and feedback formats including SWOT, Start-Stop-Continue, and custom frameworks.

**Q: Can I provide feedback or request features?**
A: Absolutely. We're building this platform for teams, and your input shapes our roadmap.
