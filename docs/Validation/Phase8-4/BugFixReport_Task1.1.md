# Bug Fix Report - Task 1.1: RetroCard Aria-Label Test

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: Verified - Tests Passing
**Task**: Fix RetroCard aria-label assertion

---

## Summary

Task 1.1 requested fixing a failing unit test in RetroCard.test.tsx that checks the aria-label for the drag handle. Upon investigation, the test was already passing - no code changes were required.

---

## Investigation

### Test Location
- File: `frontend/tests/unit/features/card/components/RetroCard.test.tsx`
- Test: "should show drag handle for standalone cards (no parent)" (line 97-103)

### Test Assertion
```typescript
expect(screen.getByTestId('card-header')).toHaveAttribute(
  'aria-label',
  'Drag handle - press Space to pick up, arrow keys to move, Space to drop'
);
```

### Source Code
- File: `frontend/src/features/card/components/RetroCard.tsx` (line 343)
```typescript
aria-label={canDrag && !hasParent ? 'Drag handle - press Space to pick up, arrow keys to move, Space to drop' : undefined}
```

### Verification Result
The aria-label in the source code exactly matches the test assertion. The test was passing at the time of investigation.

---

## Test Results

```
npm run test:run -- tests/unit/features/card/components/RetroCard.test.tsx

Test Files: 1 passed (1)
Tests: 94 passed (94)
Duration: 20.32s
```

All 94 RetroCard tests pass including:
- "should show drag handle for standalone cards (no parent)"
- "should have aria-label for full header drag handle"

---

## Conclusion

No code changes were required. The test was already passing with the correct aria-label value. The reported issue may have been from a previous state of the codebase that has since been fixed, or from a test environment issue.
